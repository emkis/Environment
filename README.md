ZSH_THEME="spaceship"

# just cool plugins
plugins=(
  git
  node
  yarn
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-completions
)

# permission to zsh use root
ZSH_DISABLE_COMPFIX=true

# i've no idea, just leave this line here
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# spaceship theme customizations
SPACESHIP_PROMPT_ORDER=(
  user          # Username section
  dir           # Current directory section

  jobs          # Background jobs indicator
  exit_code     # Exit code section
  char          # Prompt character
)

SPACESHIP_PROMPT_ADD_NEWLINE=true      # add a new line after executing a command
SPACESHIP_CHAR_SYMBOL="â¤·"             # custom symbol
SPACESHIP_CHAR_SUFFIX=" "             # character after the arrow
SPACESHIP_NODE_PREFIX=""              # removes prefix before node version

# definig path for yarn global packages
export PATH="$(yarn global bin):$PATH"

# defining path for nvm
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s  "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \.  "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
