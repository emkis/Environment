# Setting up Core dependencies

Recipe to install all core dependencies I need for the other recipes to run successfully, this should be the first one to be executed when setting up a new device.

- Run `bash ./run.sh` to setup all the core dependencies.
- After this, you should be able to run all other recipes scripts.
