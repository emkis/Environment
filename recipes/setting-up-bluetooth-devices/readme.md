# Setting up Bluetooth devices

Recipe to install and configure the tool I use for remapping some keys of my keyboard and to help me pair my bluetooth devices in a convenient way.

> This should be a simple task, but some Apple's devices like the trackpad are pretty bad to switch between devices, so this script is mostly to cover that.

- Run `bash ./run.sh` script.
- After this script finishes running successfully, all should be good.
- You can double-check by checking that Karabiner-Elements have my keyboard listed as a device and the key mappings are correct.
