# Setting up Window Manager

Recipe to install and hopefully configure the tool I use as a window manager for MacOS.

- Run `bash ./run.sh` script.
- After the script finishes running, Rectangle will be opened.
- Copy activation key and activate Rectangle.

#### If personal device

- Ensure I'm logged in into iCloud.
- Enable iCloud sync on Rectangle.
- Double-check if Rectangle already imported the custom configuration from iCloud.
- If not, import it from `./RectangleProConfig.json`.

#### If third-party device

- Disable iCloud sync on Rectangle.
- Import custom configuration from `./RectangleProConfig.json`.
